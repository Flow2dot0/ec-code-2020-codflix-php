# CodFlix project

## Setup

### Run
1. You have to use a local server such as Wamp or Mamp
1. Import the database `codflix.sql`
1. Pull the repo in the `www/` directory of your local server
1. Follow the address of your repo. For example, if your repo is in ``www/codflix/``, the URL should be http://localhost/codflix or http://127.0.0.1/codflix

Nothing else is required. You can now start your development

### Explanations

I try to clone Disney+ and Netflix UI.
I didn't work on MVC pattern as PHP.
I maybe not did all the features. But I did new features according to the UX Experience. Hope you like !
I would need a global state management for the favorite feature (I guess it's better for my media home tab view and others).
For the BO directory, all mothers classes are written by a handmade php script made with my boss (confidential, I can't share).
Search working with AND OR conditions.
Some features are not linked to the front, but the back end code exists.
Mailing on registering or contact is really working, try with your own email address.
I know I probably did too much, I hope this will be taken into account for the notation :).
